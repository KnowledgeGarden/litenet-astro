GOALS
- understand what it takes to put LiteNet into Astro
- thinking about pivot browsing:
-- users
-- topics
-- relation types
--???
- Thinking about collaboration, which might entail LiteWeight features combined with LiteNet
-- Channels for major topics, with IBIS cards
-- DM channels among users and groups
- Potential to be a feature in a K-Hub
