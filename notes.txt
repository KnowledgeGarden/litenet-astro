GOALS
- understand what it takes to put LiteNet into Astro
- thinking about pivot browsing:
-- users
-- topics
-- relation types
--???
- Thinking about collaboration, which might entail LiteWeight features combined with LiteNet
-- Channels for major topics, with IBIS cards
-- DM channels among users and groups
- Potential to be a feature in a K-Hub

    Thinking about "rapid lists"; you pick, say, a disease and it lists any topic
      which is connected to that, including nutrients, etc.
      Possibly paint with echarts so that you can walk "the graph"
      This is essenially an outline view, which, with hyperlinks, lets you navigate
      That requires a Join query off the root topic to find links in relations
        which are either sources or targets
    Question: How could QP Theory fit into this platform?
    Question: should backside be, say, Java to integrate with OpenSherlock?
      That means queries are not fronside, but backside, returning JSON stuff
      This means: boot backside, then boot frontside which makes ajax calls to populate
        views -- view first 
    Pretty much decided to use BigInts for all IDs rather than strings
