GOALS
- understand what it takes to put LiteNet into Astro
- thinking about pivot browsing:
-- users
-- topics
-- relation types
--???
- Thinking about collaboration, which might entail LiteWeight features combined with LiteNet
-- Channels for major topics, with IBIS cards
-- DM channels among users and groups
- Potential to be a feature in a K-Hub

    Thinking about "rapid lists"; you pick, say, a disease and it lists any topic
      which is connected to that, including nutrients, etc.
      Possibly paint with echarts so that you can walk "the graph"
      That requires a Join query off the root topic to find links in relations
        which are either sources or targets
    Question: How could QP Theory fit into this platform?
